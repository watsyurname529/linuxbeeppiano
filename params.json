Just apt-get install beep, and it should install (tested with Debian 7).\r\n\r\nThe next step to ensure perfect operation is to make sure that the script knows where your Python is. No, it's not in your pants. It's probably in a /bin directory somewhere. Anyway, just edit the first line with the path of your python executable.\r\n\r\nAfter that, just run the script in BASH or your favorite terminal and BAM. You have a piano.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
